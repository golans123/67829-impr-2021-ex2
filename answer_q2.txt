Q2:
Record yourself using your smartphone (or any other recording device) and 
fast forward it using both resize_spectrogram and resize_vocoder.
Generate two audio files from the new samples, and explain the differences.

A2:
in resize_spectrogram there is no phase correction, thus there is wave interference
and the audio gets a bit corrupted. That's unlike the result of resize_vocoder.,
which has  phase correction, and thus sounds better.
