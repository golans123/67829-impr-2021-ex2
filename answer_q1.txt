Question 1
Run change_rate and change_samples with the given WAV file aria_4kHz.wav and a ratio of 2.
Listen to both change_rate.wav and change samples.wav. Can you explain the reason for the 
difference between the two?

Answer 1
change_rate returns a fast-forward version with a higher pitch than the original file, while 
change_samples returns a fast-forward version with the same pitch as the original file. The
reason for the difference is that increasing the rate of play compresses the signal, thus
increasing it's frequency, resulting in a signal with a higher pitch. On the other hand,
changing the number of sample and playing them in the original rate, results in a shorter audio,
since the are less tones to play, but it is not compressed, and thus stays in the same pitch.
